## Our Research
In the Melandri Lab, we investigate physiological and biochemical mechanisms able to confer heat and drought stress tolerance to crops and their underlying genetic control. To achieve this, we target a widened pool of genetic diversity for major crops, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), in the attempt to bring in the effect of novel alleles.
