In the Melandri Lab, we investigate physiological and biochemical mechanisms able to confer heat and drought stress tolerance to crops and their underlying genetic control. To achieve this, we target a widened pool of genetic diversity for major crops, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), in the attempt to bring in the effect of novel alleles.
