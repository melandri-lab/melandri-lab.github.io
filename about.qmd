# Research


In the Melandri Lab, we investigate physiological and biochemical mechanisms able to confer heat and drought stress tolerance to crops and their underlying genetic control. To achieve this, we target a widened pool of genetic diversity for major crops, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), in the attempt to bring in the effect of novel alleles.

:::

Our research approach employs a mix of physiological phenotyping, omics analyses, predictive modeling, and genetic mapping that we apply to field trials conducted in the Arizona low desert.

The Melandri Lab is part of the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the University of Arizona. The lab is based in [Tucson](https://bio5.org/resources) and in [Maricopa](https://mac.arizona.edu/).
