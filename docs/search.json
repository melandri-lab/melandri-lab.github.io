To achieve this, we target a widened pool of genetic diversity for major crops, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), in the attempt to bring in the effect of novel alleles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research approach employs a mix of physiological phenotyping, omics analyses, predictive modeling, and genetic mapping that we apply to field trials conducted in the Arizona low desert.\nThe Melandri Lab is part of the School of Plant Sciences at the University of Arizona. The lab is based in Tucson and in Maricopa."
